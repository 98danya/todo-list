# To-do List

The Odin Project - JavaScript Course Project:

A To-do List application built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The project used Webpack for module bundling, as well as the date-fns library for date manipulation/formatting.

User data was managed using the Web Storage API (localStorage), allowing users to maintain their data even after refreshing the page.
